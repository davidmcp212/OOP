/**
 * This is a customised level panel that is added to the main game window.
 * 
 * Features of this panel are that it implements the Runnable interface - this means 
 * that this panel runs in a separate thread, which is good for efficiency.
 * 
 * This panel is the main graphical manager class - as a JPanel each level can be drawn
 * into the panel by passing the graphics context to levels and allowing them to draw
 * into this directly.
